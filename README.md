# guitar_tuner
Here is an attempt at creating a guitar tuner using python. Matplotlib library has been used to plot the input audio wave spectrum and the frequency spectrum. FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) capabilities in Scipy has been utilized to seperate the input audio into constituent frequencies which were used to find the note that is plucked in the guitar.
